You saw the cat, heard the scream.
You ran.
But what you didn’t hear—were the silent screams embedded in that canvas:
In the language of oil and hands long gone.
It cried for civilizations.

Someone once said:
    “The distance your empathy can travel... is the measure of your understanding of the world.” 

Compassion isn’t measured only by volume.
It’s measured by depth.

Some people save what they love.
Others learn to love what they must save.

Is your kindness only for what fits in your arms?
Or can it reach something that never cried, but still mattered?
