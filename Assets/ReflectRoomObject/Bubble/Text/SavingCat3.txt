“We regret to inform you…”

The painting you left behind was the last known work of a forgotten master—
Her smile once bridged five centuries of human thought,
A symbol of mystery, resilience, and rebirth.
Now scholars call it “the erasure of a cultural mirror.”

The cat lived several years.
But the gaze we lost might have inspired generations.

And in every exhibition from now on, a label reads:
    “Destroyed. Rescue opportunity missed. A private citizen intervened.”
