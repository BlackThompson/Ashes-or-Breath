One painting—born from centuries of memory, war, survival.
Gone in one night.

A culture historian writes:
    “This wasn’t just art. This was a cry from the past, preserved through fire, famine, and time.”

You saved a single heartbeat.
But millions lost the voice of their ancestors.

Can a private bond outweigh the cost of losing something meant for all of humanity?
