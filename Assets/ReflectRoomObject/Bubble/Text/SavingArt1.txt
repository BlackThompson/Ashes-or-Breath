News sites celebrate the art you saved.
The painting becomes a symbol of preservation, logic, sacrifice.

But social media rages:
    “You let a living being die.”
    “Art can’t feel fire.”
    “He loved that cat more than himself. And she left her behind.”

A girl posts:
    “She was my neighbor. Her cat was all she had.”

You made headlines.
But not pure heroes.
