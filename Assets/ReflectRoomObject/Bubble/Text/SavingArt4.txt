You chose to save the painting because it “mattered more.”
But let’s examine that:

    The painting could be scanned, digitized, stored.
    The cat? One body. One chance.


If value is tied to replication, then wasn’t the cat more fragile?
More… irrecoverable?

What if there’s a baby? Are you giving different weights to creatures?

Was this really logic?
Or a culturally dressed-up emotional avoidance?
