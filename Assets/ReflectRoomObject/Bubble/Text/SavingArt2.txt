As the fire roared, she meowed once—small, sharp, afraid.
You turned away, cradling history.

You told yourself it was about civilization.
About future generations.
About responsibility.

But what if that logic wasn’t noble—just easier to justify?

Because grief is messy.
And guilt is clean, if you wrap it in big words like “duty” or “legacy.”

The kitty was burned.
And now you speak at conferences.
